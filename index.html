      <h2>Word Scramble Game</h2><br><p>
What is Word Scramble Game<br>
Martin Naydel created Word Scramble Games or Jumbled words in the year 1954. In the game, the letters that can make a meaningful word are scrambled or mixed up together in a random fashion when a person plays word scramble game. Players have to rearrange the letters to make a meaningful sentence. The game is more like the tasks you used to do to learn words and spellings when you were a kid. One needs to arrange the vowels and consonants to make a word which has a meaning.<br><br>

Say, for example, "CIPFIOCA." Rearrange the letters, and yes, you are right! The word is "PACIFIC." Another example is "LEPAES", which is easier than the former one. It turns out to be "PLEASE" when you unjumble the letters and rearrange them.<br><br>

How to Play Word Scramble Games?
As we have mentioned, in word scramble games, one has to re-arrange or unjumble the scrambled letters to make a meaningful word. This game is also known as unscrambling.

<h2>Anagrams</h2><br><p>
Anagram scramble is a part of word scramble. Anagram scramble refers to words or phrases that are spelled by rearranging letters. The word ‘anagram' means to discover hidden meanings by reading letters out of order. But when you play anagram scramble, you don't have to find any hidden purpose as such. You need to see letters and unjumble them from a set of scrambled words to create words that are present in it.<br><br>

By unjumbling those letters, you can make meaningful words of different lengths.<br><br>

For instance, "CIPFIOCA" – when you unjumble the letters, you get a seven-letter word called "PACIFIC."<br><br>

Again when you can pick words of different lengths from the jumbled letters "CIPFIOCA"- for instance, three-letter words like "CAP," and "PAC." Besides, you can get a two-letter word, like "If."<br><br>

You can play word scramble games, and anagram scramble both online and offline. Millions of sites on the internet allow you to perform word unscramble games free of cost or with a modicum cost of membership.<br><br><br>
